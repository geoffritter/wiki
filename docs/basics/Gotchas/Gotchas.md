# Gotchas
Every distro is going to have it's own set of rules and common problems.  It's highly recommended you familiarize your
self with some of these issues if you are trying to set up anything.  The majority of the time, guides will gloss over
or not include something that is assumed knowledge.  Sometimes it's because the person making the guide has configured
different defaults that they didn't mention.  This is especially true if you are trying to use a guide written for
Ubuntu but are trying to set it up on CentOS or Fedora.

Every distro type is going to have it's own set of rules and common problems.  It's highly recommended you familiarize
your self with some of these issue if you are trying to follow any guide on the internet.  The majority of the time,
guides will gloss over or not include some of these things at all.  This is especially true if you are trying to use an
Ubuntu guide to setup something on CentOS or Fedora.
